<!-- Create a JavaScript function named checkNumber that takes a single numeric input. The function should check if the number is:

Greater than 100: Display "The number is greater than 100."
Exactly 100: Display "The number is exactly 100."
Between 50 and 99 (inclusive): Display "The number is between 50 and 99."
Less than 50: Display "The number is less than 50."
You should use if, else if, and else statements to handle these conditions. Additionally, create an HTML page with an input field and a button to test the function. When the button is clicked, it should display the result in a p element below the input field. -->
